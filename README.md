  ```

3. **Install the Library:**
   Install the library and the header file to standard system directories so that they can be included and linked easily in other projects.

sudo cp libft.h /usr/local/include/
sudo ldconfig
```

## Usage üë©‚Äçüíª

1. **Include the Header:**
  In your C source file, include the Libft header file.
```c
#include <libft.h>
```

2. **compile your program:**
  Compile your program with the -lft option to link against the Libft library.
```bash
  gcc your_program.c -lft
```
or 
```bash
  gcc your_program.c -lft -o prog_name
```

## Example:

Example program using the libft library (named example.c)

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <libft.h>

int main() {
    char *str = "Hello, World!";
    int length = ft_strlen(str);
    printf("The length of the string is: %d\n", length);
    return 0;
}
```

Compile the example program:

```bash
  gcc example.c -lft -o example
```

Run the example program:

```bash
  ./example
```

we should see the output as 

`The length of the string is: 13`

## Cleaning up: üßπ

```bash
# Clean up object files
make clean

# Remove all generated files, including the library archive
make fclean

# Recompile everything from scratch
make re
```
